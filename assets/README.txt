# The data

Your dataset contains 4 variables. Column A is the subject number, Column B is a grouping variable (group 1 and group 2), Columns C & D contain observations from a continuous scale of measurement.  

subID - subject id
group - 1 or 2 (grouping variable)
v1 - continuous variable 1
v2 - continuous variable 2

# Your analysis task

Also in the folder is a script called 'all_analysis.R'.

The script contains all the code required to load the data, perform visualisations, run a paired sample t-test between v1 and v2, run a between groups t-test for v1, and also for v2, as well as a correlation analysis between v1 and v2.

Your task is to make a new script called 'my_analysis.R'. Make sure it is saved in your working folder.

You must copy and paste only the code you need to perform your chosen analysis into the script called 'my_analysis.R'. 
You must also add comments to the code you copy and paste over that explains what the code does.

The code you need to perform your chosen analysis includes all the steps you would take - e.g. loading and visualising the data as well as the code for the specific analysis that you have chosen.

# Other things to know about the data

The continuous variables have been normalised between 0 and 1, so they lend themselves to being DVs of a range of common psychological measurement - e.g. RT, accuracy, % on a scale of measurement. However, if your own experimental design does not readily match a value between 0 and 1, you can just state that your variables were scaled between 0 and 1. This will not affect your marks.
