applyTo: "assets/analysis.R"

All code entered into analysis.R should closely follow examples of code from the repository https://github.com/garner-code/PSYC2001_ComputingLabBook
But the code should be adapted to apply to the current example (e.g. use the functions in the example code but not necessarily the object names.)

You should scan this whole code base to get the example code.
