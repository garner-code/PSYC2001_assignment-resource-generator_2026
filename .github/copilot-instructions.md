- Perform a comprehensive - Perform a comprehensive inventory of the codebase. Search for and view:

- All build and actions pipelines.
- All project files.
- All configuration and linting files.
- For each file:

   - Explicitly indicate which commands work and which do not and the order in which commands should be run.
   - Document any errors encountered as well as the steps taken to workaround them.
